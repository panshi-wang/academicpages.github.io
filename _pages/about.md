I am a PhD candidate (expected Fall 2017) in the department of Geographical Sciences, University of Maryland. With a Bachelor’s degree in Electronic Engineering and a Master’s degree in Signal and Information Processing, I have broad interests in the filed of remote sensing and image processing and machine learning techniques for land cover mapping and change detection. My PhD study focuses on methods for characterizing global urban extent, change, and 3D structure. A major component of my research is to produce a global 30-m urban extent product using Landsat satellite data, a dataset that is fundamental to the monitoring, understanding, and modeling of global urbanization (http://beta.sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/ulandsat-hbase-v1).

I have been working towards characterizing land use and land cover change at broad spatial and temporal scales. I have been actively involved in a lot of resesarch projects. You can find more about my past and ongoing [research](https://panshi-wang.github.io/portfolio/) on this site.
