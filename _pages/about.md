I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the department of Geographical Sciences, University of Maryland (UMD) at College Park. I received my Ph.D. in Geographical Sciences at the University of Maryland in 2017. I hold M.E. and B.E. degrees in Electronic Engineering from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the University of Science and Technology of China, respectively. I have broad interests in the fileds of remote sensing, image processing and machine learning techniques for land cover mapping and change detection. My PhD study focuses on methods for characterizing global urban extent, change, and 3D structure, which led to a global 30-m product of Human Built-up and Settlement Extent (HBASE) using Landsat satellite data (https://doi.org/10.7927/H4DN434S).

I have been working towards characterizing land use and land cover change at broad spatial and temporal scales. You can find more about my past and ongoing [research](https://panshi-wang.github.io/portfolio/) on this site.
