Cities grow in 3D space. But urban remote sensing capabilities in the vertical dimension have been limited by data availability. Is it possible to characterize urban 3D structure using open datasets (such as Landsat and global DSMs)?<br/>

In this study, I found that the synergy of freely available datasets could indeed be used for characterizing urban 3D structure at large scale. Although data quality and availability issues need to be addressed, we can still map a great amount of spatial details  with innovative machine learning techniques.<br/>

Stay tuned for more updates about this research.
