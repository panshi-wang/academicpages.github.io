I developed a Landsat imagery classification method based on Hierachical Object-based Texture (HOTex). This method was applied to the 2010 Global Land Survey Landsat imagery collection to produce a circa-2010 globla map of Human Built-up and Settlement Extent (HBASE). <br/>

This work is a part of the Global Land Survey Impervious Surface Mapping Project (<https://urban.gsfc.nasa.gov>). The data products generated by this project, including the global HBASE product, will be distributed by the NASA Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC, <http://beta.sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/ulandsat>).
